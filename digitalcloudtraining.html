    <h1>Digital Cloud Training</h1>
    <h2>Hands-on Lab Exercises</h2>
        <p class="service">Lab 1: Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM)</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Created a new IAM user called <em>adamdtc</em></li>
        <li>Created a password so I can log in to this account through the AWS Management Console.</li>
        <li>Generated an <strong class="yellow-text">access key ID</strong> and <strong class="yellow-text">secret access key</strong> for this account.</li>
        <li>Added new user to a group called <em>Training</em> so I can grant access to the minimal number of resources necessary for completing labs as I need them.</li>
        <li>To start with, I'm attaching two policies to this group:
            <ul>
                <li>IAMSelfManageServiceSpecificCredentials</li>
                <li>IAMUserChangePassword</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added the following tags to identify this account so I know it is to be used for training labs from a specific course.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key</strong>: Provider, <strong>Value</strong>: Digital Cloud Training</li>
                <li><strong>Key</strong>: Instructor, <strong>Value</strong>: Neal Davis</li>
                <li><strong>Key</strong>: Course, <strong>Value</strong>: AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate </li>
                <li><strong>Key</strong>: Platform, <strong>Value</strong>: Udemy</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>This user will sign in through the custom link created under my room account: <a href="https://ajsnetiker.signin.aws.amazon.com/console" target="_blank">https://ajsnetiker.signin.aws.amazon.com/console</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong style="color: #FF0000;">Problem</strong><br>
        After looking closely, I realized that I accidentally set my user name to adamdtc instead of adamdct (the c and the t are in the wrong order). It should be DCT, as in &quot;Digital Cloud Training&quot;.
        <br><br>
            <strong style="color: #FF0000;">Solution</strong><br>
        I solved this problem by taking the following steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Ran <strong class="yellow-text">aws configure</strong> through the command line to update access keys to those of my new training account.</li>
                <li>Attached the policy <em>IAMFullAccess</em> to the Training group, which includes <em>iam:UpdateUser</em>, a policy that allows me to change the user name of this account programatically.</li>
                <li>Ran <strong class="yellow-text">aws iam update-user --user-name adamdtc --new-user-name adamdct</strong> to execute the name changee.</li>
                <li>Detached the policy <em>IAMFullAccess</em> from the Training group to make sure full access was only temporary.</li>
            </ol>
