        <p class="service">Project 1: Getting Started with GitHub</p>
        <p>Since I've been working on this project for a while, I've already set up a <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> and a repository called <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker/AdamOnAWS" target="_blank">AdamOnAWS</a>. This activity serves as a great introduction to version control, and it's nice to see contribution activity in my account.</p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Git Commands</b><br>
            <code>git add <strong class="yellow-text">[file name]</strong> or <strong class="yellow-text">*</strong> or <strong class="yellow-text">*.extension</strong></code>
            <br>
            <code>git commit -m <strong class="yellow-text">"Message about new commit here."</strong></code>
            <br>
            <code>git push origin <strong class="yellow-text">[repository name]</strong></code>
        </p>
        
        <p class="service">Project 2: Setting up Your First Azure Environment</p>
            <p>I used to work with a startup that hired developers who used Azure. I created an account and gave them permission to connect, so I already completed this step. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the portal, I started a free trial for 12 months along with receiving a $200 credit to use on services that aren't free. To do this, I had to verify my phone number and add a credit card, just like I did with AWS.</li></ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 3: Setting up Your First AWS Environment</p>
            <p>Since I've been using AWS for a couple of months already, I have a fully-functional account. Even though I'm only building a project for myself, I actually created two accounts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong class="yellow-text">root account</strong>, on which I enabled MFA.</li>
            <li>An <strong class="yellow-text">IAM account</strong>, used to administer all services following best practices.</li></ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 4: Setting up Projects in GitHub</p>
            <p>Under the <strong class="yellow-text">Projects</strong> tab in GitHub, I created a new project using the <em>Basic Kanban</em> template to track the status of tasks. This board includes three columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To do</li>
            <li>In progress</li>
            <li>Done</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other capabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a new column</li>
            <li>Drag and drop cards between columns</li>
            <li>Search for and add issues to projects or repositories</li>
            <li>Automate various board tasks</li>
            <li>Archive cards or full columns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 5: Setting up Your First GitHub Action</p>
        <p>Earlier, I set up a workflow to sync my repo with my S3 bucket. It wasn't working successfully, but it was exposing my access keys, so I disabled it. I'm looking forward to figuring this out so I can successfully sync my files to S3 every time a new change is pushed into GitHub.</p>
