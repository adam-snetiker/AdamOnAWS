        <p class="service">Project 1: Getting Started with GitHub</p>
        <p>Since I've been working on this project for a while, I've already set up a <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> and a repository called <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker/AdamOnAWS" target="_blank">AdamOnAWS</a>. This activity serves as a great introduction to version control, and it's nice to see contribution activity in my account.</p>

        <b>Git Commands</b><br>
            <code>git add <strong class="yellow-text">[file name]</strong> or <strong class="yellow-text">*</strong> or <strong class="yellow-text">*.extension</strong></code>
            <br>
            <code>git commit -m <strong class="yellow-text">"Message about new commit here."</strong></code>
            <br>
            <code>git push origin <strong class="yellow-text">[repository name]</strong></code>
        </p>
        
        <p class="service">Project 2: Setting up Your First Azure Environment</p>
            <p>I used to work with a startup that hired developers who used Azure. I created an account and gave them permission to connect, so I already completed this step. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the portal, I started a free trial for 12 months along with receiving a $200 credit to use on services that aren't free. To do this, I had to verify my phone number and add a credit card, just like I did with AWS.</li></ul>
