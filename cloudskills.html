        <p class="service">Project 1: Getting Started with GitHub</p>
        <p>Since I've been working on this project for a while, I've already set up a <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> and a repository called <a href="https://github.com/adam-snetiker/AdamOnAWS" target="_blank">AdamOnAWS</a>. This activity serves as a great introduction to version control, and it's nice to see contribution activity in my account.</p>

        <p class="service">Project 2: Setting up Your First Azure Environment</p>
            <p>I used to work with a startup that hired developers who used Azure. I created an account and gave them permission to connect, so I already completed this step. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the portal, I started a free trial for 12 months along with receiving a $200 credit to use on services that aren't free. To do this, I had to verify my phone number and add a credit card, just like I did with AWS.</li></ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 3: Setting up Your First AWS Environment</p>
            <p>Since I've been using AWS for a couple of months already, I have a fully-functional account. Even though I'm only building a project for myself, I actually created two accounts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong class="yellow-text">root account</strong>, on which I enabled MFA.</li>
            <li>An <strong class="yellow-text">IAM account</strong>, used to administer all services following best practices.</li></ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 4: Setting up Projects in GitHub</p>
            <p>Under the <strong class="yellow-text">Projects</strong> tab in GitHub, I created a new project using the <em>Basic Kanban</em> template to track the status of tasks. This board includes three columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To do</li>
            <li>In progress</li>
            <li>Done</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other capabilities include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add a new column</li>
            <li>Drag and drop cards between columns</li>
            <li>Search for and add issues to projects or repositories</li>
            <li>Automate various board tasks</li>
            <li>Archive cards or full columns</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="service">Project 5: Setting up Your First GitHub Action</p>
        <p>Earlier, I set up a workflow to sync my repo with my S3 bucket. It wasn't working successfully, but it was exposing my access keys, so I disabled it. I'm looking forward to figuring this out so I can successfully sync my files to S3 every time a new change is pushed into GitHub.</p>

        <h3>Week 2: Scripting Like a Developer</h3>
        <p class="service">Project 1: Setting up a Dev Environment from Start to Finish</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Installed Visual Studio Code</li>
        <li>Installed Python and PowerShell extensions. Had to download .vsix files and install these into VS Code manually.</li>
            <li>Signed up for <strong class="yellow-text">GitHub Codespaces</strong> beta waitlist</li>
        </ul>
        
        
         <p class="service">Project 2: Reusable and Clean Python Code</p>
       <p>In this project, I used Python to create an S3 bucket with the <strong class="yellow-text">Boto3</strong> library, which is used to access AWS resources. First, I attempted to install boto3 using the command  <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">pip install boto3</code> in the terminal tab of VS Code. When running my code, I got an error message saying the module didn't exist, so I had to research a different way to solve the problem.
        <br><br>
        I found an alternative and set up the <strong class="yellow-text">AWS SDK</strong> for Python using the following commands:<br><br> 
            <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding-top: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px;">
                $ pip install virtualenv<br>
                $ cd boto3<br>
                $ virtualenv venv<br>
                ...<br>
                $ . venv/bin/activate<br>
                $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
                $ python -m pip install -e .
           </code>
        <br><br>
        This solved the first problem, but when I ran the code again I got an error saying the unspecified location constraint is not compatible with the endpoint to which the command was sent. After researching <em>this</em> problem, I solved it by adding the following to my code:
        <br><br>
        <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">
           CreateBucketConfiguration = {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'LocationConstraint': 'us-west-1'<br>
           },</code>
        <br><br>
        After solving this problem as well, I was met with an access denied error. To fix this, I went back to the console and signed in under my root account. I then granted the <strong class="yellow-text">S3FullAccess</strong> policy to the IAM account I'm using to connect to AWS from my local machine. 
        <br><br>
        A quick look at the S3 bucket list confirms successful creation of a new bucket called <em>snetcloudnative</em>. I can now reuse this code any time I want to create a new s3 bucket by running the command <br>
        <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">python3 ./s3bucket.py <em>bucketname</em></code>
        
         <p class="service">Project 3: Reusable and Clean PowerShell Code</p>
        
        <p>For this project, the task is to write a PowerShell script that creates a new <strong class="yellow-text">Azure resource group</strong>. Since I'm starting from scratch, I need to install both PowerShell and the Azure CLI.
        <br><br>
        In order to run Homebrew, I first had to convert the shallow clone to a full clone using the following commands:<br><br> <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core fetch --unshallow</code><br> <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">git -C /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask fetch --unshallow</code>
        <br><br>
         Before I install the Azure CLI, it appears I have to install Xcode Developer tools  using the command <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">xcode-select --install</code>. After that, and once I have a full clone of Homebrew, I'm able to
        I'm able to successfully install the <strong class="yellow-text">Azure CLI</strong> using <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">brew update &amp;&amp; brew install azure-cli</code>.
            
        <br><br>To begin, I installed PowerShell using the command  <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">brew install --cask powershell</code> and verified that it's working with  <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">pwsh</code>. This is also used to start the shell, which is necessary because otherwise I'd be running commands in Bash. In VS Code, it appears the default shell is zsh.
        <br><br>
         When running my code, I ran into an error that said the module was not part of a cmdlet, script or file. Basically, PowerShell couldn't find the specific Azure CLI command I want to use, which is <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">New-AzResourceGroup</code>. To troubleshoot the problem, here are the steps I took:
            <ul>
                <li>Looked up how to install a PowerShell module<li>
                <li>Found the name of the correct module that contains the New-AzResourceGroup command</li>
                <li>Ran a search for the module and installed it once it was found. The correct module for this project is <strong class="yellow-text">Az.Resources</strong>. The command I used to find and install the module is <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">Find-Module -Name Az.Resources | Install-Module</code>.</li>
                <li>Added <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">Import-Module Az.Resources</code> to the top of my code to import the module.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to successfully run the code, I had to run <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">Connect-AzAccount</code>, which opened a browser tab so I could log in to Azure. Finally, after the connection was established, I ran <code style="background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 4px;">New-ResourceGroup -rgName snetRG01 -location westus</code> to create a resource group called snetRG01 in the West US region.
        <br><br>Last but not least, I was able to confirm successful creation of the resource group in the Azure console.</p>
        
                
            </ul>
