# AdamOnAWS

I want to be a Solutions Architect, but haven't had a full-time job in the field or real-world experience. I'm building a website that's fully-contained in the cloud to apply what I'm learning from certification material and to give myself the opportunity to prove I have the knowledge and hands-on skills working with the services I will use in a full-time role.

As my abilities become more advanced, I'll add more complex features to this project. Currently, it consists of a static website that documents micro-tasks I have completed to get the website up and running. The homepage is complete and I'm now working on a contact page that will use AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon SES to send all inquiries from the form to my email address.
