I want to be a Solutions Architect, but haven't had a full-time job in the field or real-world experience. I'm building a website that's fully-contained in the cloud to apply what I'm learning from certification material and to give myself the opportunity to prove I have the knowledge and hands-on experience working with the services I will use in a full-time role.
